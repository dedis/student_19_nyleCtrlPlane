abstract = {Distributed systems achieve scalability by distributing load across
    many machines, but wide-area deployments can introduce worst-case response
        latencies proportional to the network's diameter. Crux is a general
        framework to build locality-preserving distributed systems, by
        transforming an existing scalable distributed algorithm A into a new
        locality-preserving algorithm ALP, which guarantees for any two clients
        u and v interacting via ALP that their interactions exhibit worst-case
        response latencies proportional to the network latency between u and v.
        Crux builds on compact-routing theory, but generalizes these techniques
        beyond routing applications. Crux provides weak and strong consistency
        flavors, and shows latency improvements for localized interactions in
        both cases, specifically up to several orders of magnitude for
        weakly-consistent Crux (from roughly 900ms to 1ms). We deployed on
        PlanetLab locality-preserving versions of a Memcached distributed
        cache, a Bamboo distributed hash table, and a Redis publish/subscribe.
        Our results indicate that Crux is effective and applicable to a variety
        of existing distributed algorithms.}, archivePrefix = {arXiv},

abstract = {The DFINITY blockchain computer provides a secure, performant and
    flexible consensus mechanism. At its core, DFINITY contains a decentralized
        randomness beacon which acts as a verifiable random function (VRF) that
        produces a stream of outputs over time. The novel technique behind the
        beacon relies on the existence of a unique-deterministic,
    non-interactive, DKG-friendly threshold signatures scheme. The only known
        examples of such a scheme are pairing-based and derived from BLS. The
        DFINITY blockchain is layered on top of the DFINITY beacon and uses the
        beacon as its source of randomness for leader selection and leader
        ranking. A "weight" is attributed to a chain based on the ranks of the
        leaders who propose the blocks in the chain, and that weight is used to
        select between competing chains. The DFINITY blockchain is layered on
        top of the DFINITY beacon and uses the beacon as its source of
        randomness for leader selection and leader ranking blockchain is
        further hardened by a notarization process which dramatically improves
        the time to finality and eliminates the nothing-at-stake and selfish
        mining attacks. DFINITY consensus algorithm is made to scale through
        continuous quorum selections driven by the random beacon. In practice,
    DFINITY achieves block times of a few seconds and transaction finality
        after only two confirmations. The system gracefully handles temporary
        losses of network synchrony including network splits, while it is
        provably secure under synchrony.}, archivePrefix = {arXiv},

abstract = {While showing great promise, Bitcoin requires users to wait tens of
    minutes for transactions to commit, and even then, offering only
        probabilistic guarantees. This paper introduces ByzCoin, a novel
        Byzantine consen-sus protocol that leverages scalable collective
        signing to commit Bitcoin transactions irreversibly within seconds.
        ByzCoin achieves Byzantine consensus while preserv-ing Bitcoin's open
        membership by dynamically form-ing hash power-proportionate consensus
        groups that rep-resent recently-successful block miners. ByzCoin
        em-ploys communication trees to optimize transaction com-mitment and
        verification under normal operation while guaranteeing safety and
        liveness under Byzantine faults, up to a near-optimal tolerance of f
        faulty group members among 3 f + 2 total. ByzCoin mitigates double
        spend-ing and selfish mining attacks by producing collectively signed
        transaction blocks within one minute of trans-action submission.
        Tree-structured communication fur-ther reduces this latency to less
        than 30 seconds. Due to these optimizations, ByzCoin achieves a
        throughput higher than Paypal currently handles, with a confirma-tion
        latency of 15-20 seconds.}, archivePrefix = {arXiv},

abstract = {A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online
    payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going
        through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the
        solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is
        still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the
        double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network
        timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of
        hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed
        without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as
        proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from
        the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is
        controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network,
    they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network
        itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best
        effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will,
    accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while

abstract = {Abstract. Let G = (V, E) be an undirected weighted graph with |V| =
    n and |E| = m. Let k ≥ 1 be an integer. We show that G = (V, E) can be
        preprocessed in O(kmn 1/k) expected time, constructing a data structure
        of size O(kn 1+1/k), such that any subsequent distance query can be
        answered, approximately, in O(k) time. The approximate distance
        returned is of stretch at most 2k - 1, that is, the quotient obtained
        by dividing the estimated distance by the actual distance lies between
        1 and 2k - 1. A 1963 girth conjecture of Erdo″s, implies that
        fl(n'+1/*) space is needed in the worst case for any real stretch
                 strictly smaller than 2k + 1. The space requirement of our
                 algorithm is, therefore, essentially optimal. The most
                 impressive feature of our data structure is its constant query
                 time, hence the name "oracle". Previously, data structures
                 that used only O(n 1+1/k) space had a query time of n(n 1/k).
                 Our algorithms are extremely simple and easy to implement

@article{Wang2019,
abstract = {Cryptocurrencies have provided a promising infrastructure for
pseudonymous online payments. However, low throughput has significantly
hindered the scalability and usability of cryptocurrency systems for increasing
numbers of users and transactions. Another obstacle to achieving scalability is
the requirement for every node to duplicate the communication, storage, and
state representation of the entire network. In this paper, we introduce the
Asynchronous Consensus Zones, which scales blockchain system linearly without
compromising decentralization or security. We achieve this by running multiple
independent and parallel instances of single-chain consensus systems termed as
zones. The consensus happens independently within each zone with minimized
communication, which partitions the workload of the entire network and ensures
a moderate burden for each individual node as the network grows. We propose
eventual atomicity to ensure transaction atomicity across zones, which achieves
the efficient completion of transactions without the overhead of a two-phase
commit protocol. Additionally, we propose Chu-ko-nu mining to ensure the
effective mining power in each zone to be at the same level of the entire
network, making an attack on any individual zone as hard as that on the full
network. Our experimental results show the effectiveness of our work: on a
testbed including 1,200 virtual machines worldwide to support 48,000 nodes, our
system delivers 1,000× throughput and 2,000× capacity over the Bitcoin and

linear in the number of replicas. To our knowledge, HotStuff is the first
partially synchronous BFT replication protocol exhibiting these combined
properties. HotStuff is built around a novel framework that forms a bridge
between classical BFT foundations and blockchains. It allows the expression of
other known protocols (DLS, PBFT, Tendermint, Casper), and ours, in a common
framework. Our deployment of HotStuff over a network with over 100 replicas

        machines, threshold signatures and witness cosigning, and verifiable
        secret sharing. This combination of existing abstractions and threshold
